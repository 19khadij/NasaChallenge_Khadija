        <h2 class="sub-head">Transit method</h2>
        <div class="exoplanet-item">
            <p>For an observer, when a planet passes in front of its star, it is called a "transit." From Earth's point
                of view, we can see Venus and Mercury crossing in front of the Sun on rare occasions. Planets can also
                transit in front of distant stars. When this happens, the brightness of the star appears to decrease
                temporarily.

                Astronomers can detect exoplanets by spotting these dips in the brightness of stars. Certain space
                missions like NASA's Kepler Space Telescope have been designed to stare at hundreds of thousands of
                stars at a time to detect these temporary changes. Based on the frequency of these light variations,
                scientists can determine the size and orbital period of the exoplanets. Three-quarters of known
                exoplanets have been discovered using the transit method.</p>

                When a planet passes directly between a star and its observer, it dims the star's light by a measurable
                amount. This animation shows a single planet and the corresponding light curve.

                When a planet passes directly between a star and its observer, it dims the star's light by a measurable
                amount. Larger planets block more light. This animation compares two planets of different sizes and
                shows the changes in the light curves.

                When a planet passes directly between a star and its observer, it dims the star's light by a measurable
                amount. Light curves get complicated when more planets are transiting a star. The combined light curves
                can give us the same information as a single one, it just takes more work from astronomers to pick out
                each planet in the data.

        <h2 class="sub-head">Radial velocity method </h2>
        <div class="exoplanet-item">
            <p>A planet travels along its orbit because of the gravitational pull of its star. But did you know that
                stars also move slightly – or wobble – because of the gravitational effect of their planets?

                A star's wobble is tiny compared to a planet's orbit since stars are so much bigger than planets.
                Despite this difference, instruments on modern telescopes are now sensitive enough to measure this
                wobble.

                The first exoplanet ever detected around a Sun-like star, 51 Pegasi b, was discovered using the radial
                velocity method in 1995. Here's how it works: as a star wobbles, moving towards and away from the
                observing telescope due to the presence of one or many planets, the light it emits is affected.
                Scientists can calculate how fast a star is wobbling by measuring the intensity of the Doppler effect –
                the stretching and compression of lightwaves. The faster the wobble, the bigger and closer the planet
                orbiting the star!
                The radial velocity method has Canadian roots! In the 1980s, a team of Canadian astronomers – Bruce
                Campbell, Gordon Walker and Stephenson Yang – pioneered the observational technique used to discover
                exoplanets based on radial velocity measurements.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-head">Direct imaging </h2>
            <div class="exoplanet-item">
                <p>It is extremely difficult (but not impossible!) to take direct images of planets outside our solar
                    system. Their extreme distance from Earth and tiny size (in relation to their host star) means that
                    exoplanets are very hard to capture, especially in the kind of high-resolution we are now used to
                    seeing the planets and asteroids within our own solar system.

                    To directly image an exoplanetary system, scientists block out the central star to prevent its glare
                    from drowning out the planets. Direct imaging is easier if the planets are relatively far away from
                    their star, or if the whole system is young, as young planets are brighter and easier to spot.
                    Astronomers have even been able to directly observe planets as they are being formed!

                    The challenges of direct imaging – distance, glare, some planets' small size – mean that most of the
                    images of exoplanets in popular media are artists' concepts of what the distant worlds might look
                    like. Scientists have only been able to directly image a handful of exoplanets; in 2008, a team of
                    Canadian astronomers was the first to directly image a multi-planet system, the planets around star
                    HR 8799.</p>
