        <h2>51 Pegasi b        </h2>
        <div class="exoplanet-item">

            <p>51 Pegasi b was the first exoplanet ever discovered orbiting a star that resembles our Sun. Also the
                first Hot Jupiter ever observed, this gas giant located 50 light-years from Earth takes only 4.2 days to
                orbit its star.
                51 Pegasi b's discovery in 1995 by Swiss astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz surprised the
                scientific community since models of planetary formation at the time did not predict its existence. The
                pair later won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2019 for their achievement.</p>

        <h2>Kepler-22b        </h2>
        <div class="exoplanet-item">
            <img src="Exoplanet-Kepler-22b.jpg" alt="Exoplanet Kepler 22b" class="exoplanet-image">
            <p>Roughly twice the size of Earth, Kepler-22b was discovered in 2011 by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope. The
                exoplanet was the first to be found in any star's habitable zone.
                Although scientists are unsure what Kepler-22b looks like, the exoplanet orbits its star at just the
                right distance – where a planet is most likely to have a climate that would allow any water on its
                surface to remain liquid.
                This area is also called the Goldilocks Zone, since the conditions are not too hot, not too cold, but
                just right. However, there are no guarantees that this exoplanet, located about 600 light-years away
                from Earth, hosts alien life, or that humans could live on it.</p>

        <h2>Proxima Centauri b        </h2>
        <div class="exoplanet-item">
            <img src="Exoplanet-Proxima-Centauri-b.jpg" alt="Exoplanet Proxima Centauri b" class="exoplanet-image">
            <p>Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Sun. This red dwarf star is located 4.2 light-years – or 40
                trillion kilometres – away from Earth. An exoplanet, Proxima Centauri b, was detected orbiting this star
                in 2016.
                Proxima Centauri b is a rocky planet that is a bit larger than Earth. Like Kepler-22b, it is also
                located in its star's habitable zone. Scientists find this exoplanet very intriguing, but they will have
                to continue studying it from afar – even using the fastest space probe ever built, the Parker Solar
                Probe which could travel at speeds of up to 724,000 km/h, it would take almost 7000 years to reach
                Proxima Centauri b!
                In 2020, scientists confirmed the existence of a second planet in this system: Proxima Centauri c. This
                super-Earth or mini-Neptune is about 7 times as massive as our planet, but orbits its star beyond the
                habitable zone.</p>

        <!-- <div class="overlay-text2" id="text2">
            A wide variety of planets exist in our solar system, ranging from rocky planets (like Earth) to gas giants
            (like Jupiter). Exoplanets are even more diverse. Here are some of the types that make up the zoo of
            exoplanets:
            Hot Jupiters: Large gas giants like Jupiter, but with one key difference – they are found very close to
            their host star, even closer than Mercury is to the Sun
            Mini-Neptunes and Super-Earths: The most common type of exoplanet observed by scientists, these could be
            supersized rocky planets, or gas planets smaller than Neptune
            Ocean worlds: Exoplanets that feature a rocky core which is completely covered by a vast liquid ocean
            hundreds of kilometres deep
            Rocky worlds: Earth- or Mars-like planets with a solid surface, which may or may not include small oceans or
            have an atmosphere
            According to astronomers, over 50 percent of stars likely host at least one planet. Scientists continue to
            discover surprising alien worlds that are sometimes stranger than fiction – and the discovery of these
            faraway planets can mark important milestones in the history of astronomy.
