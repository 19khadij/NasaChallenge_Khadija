            Detecting Exoplanets

            Researchers are able to take incredible pictures of the planets in our solar system using powerful
            telescopes and space probes. But exoplanets, which orbit distant stars, are more difficult to directly
            observe, because they are much farther away and close to their extremely bright stars. Instead, astronomers
            often detect exoplanets indirectly, through the effect they have on their host star.
