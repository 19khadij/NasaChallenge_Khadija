Enter the vast expanse of the cosmos, where the story of exoplanets unfolds — a journey across light-years to worlds waiting to be discovered beneath new constellations.


Scientists have long wondered if stars other than our Sun could also have planets orbiting them. In the last few decades, astronomers have been able to detect thousands of these planets beyond our solar system. We now know of over 5000 exoplanets and counting!

An exoplanet is a planet that is outside our solar system. Exoplanets are typically found orbiting a star other than our Sun. In the same way that our solar system contains eight planets, other stars can have many exoplanets in orbit around them.
